a single moving magnet can be realized by generating a large bg imgae and move it with the magnet

BG image could always move with player in the center

a second player could be added with collision and magnetic forces

the goal of the 2nd player could be to disturb the first one - or just to be faster.

magnet accelerator levels could work like car races

different magnet shapes, magnet compounds, different magnetizations, different drag, inertia etc. etc.

accumulate SM pieces that get attracted to the player and make him heavy AND increase size

elastic collistion obstacles

build your own level
